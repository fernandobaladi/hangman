# Hangman by Fernando Baladi

This is my version of a simple python hangman game. 

# Rules

Rules are simple:

* You have 6 lifes.
* If you enter more than a letter, you'll loose a life.
* If you enter a letter repeated, you'll loose a life.
* If you enter a letter that isn't in the hidden word, you'll loose a life (basic rule).

# Requirements

* Python 3 or superior

If you like it give me a star!
